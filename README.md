# Data Structure Apps 02
This repo is a extention of the first one, so four more applications: <br/>
  FactorySimulatorGUI, BooleanExpressionTreeGUI, HashSetWithChaining, and JourneyPlanner <br/>
Each of these applications demostrate the use of data structures and algorithms around it. <br/>
For example FactorySimulatorGUI uses PriorityQueue inorder to have machines producing parcels and dispatchers that consume the parcels efficiently
